# XR Sandbox – Research & Design Documentation

This repository contains process documentation, reflective analysis, and supporting artifacts for the Master’s Research Project **_Shifting Sands: Critical Data Physicalization for Environmental Engagement_**, completed as part of the MSc in Digital Media at York University.

The documentation follows a **PRT (Project Reflection Tool / Conversational Analysis)** structure inspired by Dalsgaard & Halskov’s framework for reflective design documentation. Entries capture not only outcomes, but the material, institutional, and epistemic conditions under which design and research activities unfolded.
