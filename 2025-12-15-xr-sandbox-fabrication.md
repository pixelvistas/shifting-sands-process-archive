# 2025-12-15 – XR Sandbox Fabrication and Material Assembly Phase

## Timestamp
September–December 2025

## Information

**Location**  
Fabrication took place primarily at the AMPD Makerspace at York University. Background research, planning, and documentation work were conducted off-site at the researcher’s home workspace. The project was later relocated in anticipation of continued fabrication at the Lassonde machine shop.

**Participants**  
- Shelby Murchie (primary researcher, designer, and fabricator)  
- Jasmin (research assistant; assembly support and background research)  
- Melanie (primary supervisor; indirect oversight)  
- Jane (secondary supervisor; indirect oversight)  
- Lassonde machine shop staff (anticipated involvement; fabrication pending)

**Resources / Tools**  
- 1010-series aluminum extrusions  
- Compatible T-slot screws, interior L-shaped corner brackets, exterior joiner plates  
- 3/4-inch plywood  
- Bandsaw (aluminum extrusion cutting)  
- CNC machine (partially unavailable)  
- Fusion 360 (CAD modeling and DXF preparation)  
- Funding support via the PiET Lab through the Lassonde Research Centre, York University

**Purpose / Goals**  
The goal of this phase was to construct the full physical frame of the XR Sandbox in preparation for subsequent phases of the project, including software development, procurement of sand and computing hardware, and integration of the Kinect depth sensor and projection system following the winter holiday break.

## Description

This fabrication phase marked the researcher’s first experience constructing a large-scale physical system of this complexity. The process was iterative and often nonlinear, involving substantial trial and error. Early work focused on learning the properties of 1010-series aluminum extrusions and their accessory ecosystems. Through multiple rounds of ordering, assembly, and correction, the researcher developed an understanding of extrusion compatibility, fastener selection, and alternative assembly strategies when preferred components were unavailable.

Design work in Fusion 360 began concurrently with the ordering of aluminum extrusions, accessories, plywood, and the projector. When it became clear that the Makerspace CNC machine was non-operational, permission was granted for the plywood components to be hand-cut. During assembly, inaccuracies in hole placement were discovered: holes had been drilled on incorrect faces of the long and short walls. This necessitated additional drilling and repair using plaster to fill unused holes.

Shortly thereafter, the Makerspace was shut down without advance notice, prompting an emergency relocation of the project, which was learned about informally through another lab member. The partially assembled system was moved the same day. The researcher then initiated contact with the Lassonde machine shop to complete the remaining fabrication, including recutting the long and short walls and fabricating a precise mounting plate for the projector.

Progress slowed significantly due to the winter holiday break and a subsequent handoff between machine shop managers. Administrative friction emerged around the requirement for engineering drawings and issues with the cost centre number associated with the project. Despite multiple follow-ups, communication stalled, leaving key components unfinished at the end of the period.

Throughout this phase, collaboration with the research assistant was both productive and affectively complex. Assembly work was shared effectively, and additional research tasks were delegated, including the creation of a shared Discord repository for code and project organization. At the same time, the researcher navigated uncertainty around leadership, responsibility, and perceptions of competence while managing delays largely outside of their control.

## Conclusion

**Key Insights**  
- Fabrication learning was substantial, encompassing aluminum extrusion systems, CAD modeling, tolerances, and engineering considerations.  
- The distinction between designed precision and materially enacted messiness became conceptually significant.  
- Infrastructure, access, and institutional coordination emerged as active forces shaping the design process rather than neutral backdrops.  
- Despite incomplete fabrication, moments of assembly provided tangible affirmation of progress and capability.

**Challenges and Limitations**  
- CNC machine failure and reliance on hand-cut components compromised precision.  
- Sudden space closures and administrative handoffs introduced significant delays.  
- Time emerged as the dominant constraint, compounded by institutional latency and waiting periods.  
- Emotional and cognitive load affected momentum and confidence, particularly under deadline pressure.

**Impact on Research Trajectory**  
This fabrication phase reframed the XR Sandbox not as a stable platform but as a situated, materially contingent system. Precision versus messiness emerged as an epistemic concern rather than a purely technical one, foregrounding questions about cost, scalability, and labor in data physicalization. The experience sharpened critical awareness of solutionism and reinforced the need for carefully scoped, meaningful extensions to existing research rather than novelty for its own sake.

**Decisions Made**  
- Commitment to an additional semester to allow the project to unfold without overreach.  
- Recognition that future fabrication would prioritize machine shop resources over makerspace facilities.  
- Acceptance of infrastructural constraint as part of the research material rather than a deviation from it.

**Next Steps**  
- Completion of remaining fabricated components via the machine shop.  
- Transition to software integration and dataset experimentation.  
- Refinement of research questions around appropriate datasets, novelty, and pedagogical value.

## Highlighted Reflections

> “What appeared as failure in fabrication functioned instead as a critical lens, revealing data physicalization as a situated, material, and epistemically active process.”

> “Across the project’s evolution, interaction design shifted from a usability concern to an epistemic framing device that determines what kinds of questions the data physicalization can meaningfully support.”
